      <span> Hello readers!! Good to see you reading. I am RINDEN. Anyway, GOOD Morning🔆. it has been cozy morning. I am inaudibly sleepy🥱 right now because I guess the time here is around 5:00 am. Let me verify that on my desktop. Aha! It is - - - ‘’ting toe”. Opps that was my computer. Wait! 😮 Hang on a second. Sorry for the hiatus. It said that, I have to solve a mission today. A really ENIGMATIC 🤔 mission (ohh! sounds like a really cool one). And I will have inevitably a mission each month!! Guess what? I 🧡 love missions. Principally, the cryptic 🤔 one. a positive news: this online 📧 corresponded made a flight ✈ ticket to CHINA 🎎 (since my mission is on china) in place of me doing it.

Let’s primary fasten our seat belts. Pause ⏸ there, why is there an envelope on my lap. Ok. This supposed to be mine since it says “To RINDEN”. Let me just place it in my little Gladstone for now and have a peep at it after I get out the aircraft 🛬. Several questions ❓ flashed through my mind, doesn’t let me concentrate on my work 🎎.
